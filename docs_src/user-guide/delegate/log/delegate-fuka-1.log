piyo@vmpc:~/example/delegate$ ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml delegate1.yml 
ERROR! 'delegate_to' is not a valid attribute for a TaskInclude

The error appears to be in '/home/piyo/example/delegate/delegate1.yml': line 7, column 7, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

  tasks:
    - name: include any tasks
      ^ here
