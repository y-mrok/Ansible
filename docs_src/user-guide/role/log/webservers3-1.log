piyo@vmpc:~/example/role$ ansible-playbook -i hosts2.yml webservers3.yml 
ERROR! couldn't resolve module/action 'ansible.builtin.rpm'. This often indicates a misspelling, missing collection, or incorrect module path.

The error appears to be in '/home/piyo/example/role/roles/basic_webserver_configuration2/tasks/main.yml': line 2, column 3, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

---
