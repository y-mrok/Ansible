piyo@vmpc:~/example/role$ ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml roles1.yml 
ERROR! You cannot use loops on 'import_role' statements. You should use 'include_role' instead.

The error appears to be in '/home/piyo/example/role/roles1.yml': line 6, column 7, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

  tasks:
    - name: The ansible.builtin.import_role module with the loop directive set
      ^ here
