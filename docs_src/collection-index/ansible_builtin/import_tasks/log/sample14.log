ERROR! Error when evaluating variable in import path: ./imports/imp_{{ ansible_facts['distribution'] }}.yml.

When using static imports, ensure that any variables used in their names are defined in vars/vars_files
or extra-vars passed in from the command line. Static imports cannot use variables from facts or inventory
sources like group or host vars.
