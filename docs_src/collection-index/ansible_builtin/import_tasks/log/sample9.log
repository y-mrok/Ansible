piyo@vmpc:~/example/collection$ ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml sample9.yml 
ERROR! couldn't resolve module/action 'ansible.builtin.debugging'. This often indicates a misspelling, missing collection, or incorrect module path.

The error appears to be in '/home/piyo/example/collection/imports/imp_task3.yml': line 7, column 3, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:


- name: List of tasks to import No.2
