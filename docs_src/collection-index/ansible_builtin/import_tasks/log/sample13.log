piyo@vmpc:~/example/collection$ ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml sample13.yml 
ERROR! You cannot use loops on 'import_tasks' statements. You should use 'include_tasks' instead.

The error appears to be in '/home/piyo/example/collection/sample13.yml': line 9, column 7, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:


    - name: import tasks
      ^ here
piyo@vmpc:~/example/collection$
