piyo@vmpc:~/example/collection$ ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml sample4.yml 
ERROR! 'become' is not a valid attribute for a TaskInclude

The error appears to be in '/home/piyo/example/collection/sample4.yml': line 8, column 7, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:


    - name: Include tasks
      ^ here
